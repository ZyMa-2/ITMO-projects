My name is Mikhail, and I am 18 years old programmer from kz. After graduating physics mathematical school 
I decided to study abroad in Russia and
now I am first-year student at ITMO University, 
studying computer science. 
Also i can say that i am ambitious, initiative and energetic person that want to make a good career at software engineering.

Unfortunately, I'm bad at time management and not very good at communication,
despite this I always find a way out of a difficult situation,
and my positives traits always overlap my weaknesses
